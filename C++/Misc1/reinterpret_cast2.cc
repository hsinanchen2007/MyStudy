/*
    reinterpret_cast is a type of casting operator used in C++. 
    
    It is used to convert a pointer of some data type into a pointer of another data type, 
    even if the data types before and after conversion are different.
    It does not check if the pointer type and data pointed by the pointer is same or not.
    Syntax : 
    
    data_type *var_name = 
        reinterpret_cast <data_type *>(pointer_variable);
    Return Type 
    
    It doesnâ€™t have any return type. It simply converts the pointer type.
    Parameters 
    
    It takes only one parameter i.e., the source pointer variable (p in above example).

    Purpose for using reinterpret_cast 
    
    reinterpret_cast is a very special and dangerous type of casting operator. And is suggested 
    to use it using proper data type i.e., (pointer data type should be same as original data type).
    It can typecast any pointer to any other data type.
    It is used when we want to work with bits.
    If we use this type of cast then it becomes a non-portable product. So, it is suggested not to 
    use this concept unless required.
    It is only used to typecast any pointer to its original type.
    Boolean value will be converted into integer value i.e., 0 for false and 1 for true.
