    * From Leetcode Curated Algo 170 (24/170)
        * NOTE: Based on the frequency, as these questions required $$$, most FAANG Company
                didn't use them, I guess this is due to NOT formally ask interviewers to pay
                and use LC, and from AlgoMonster, some companies required NOT asking exact 
                same LC question to interviewers, that may be why this part is must lower
